Spot For Shoes

This is an application used for rating a shoe and leaving a review for a particular shoe.
The reason I created this application is because I believe that we should have one place
where anyone can go and look to get information about a shoe that they are looking to buy. Also,
if you had a bad experience or good experience with a shoe this application would be a good
resource. 

Each user is able to sign up using oauth authentication or simply sign up with a username.
Once the user is signed in, the user is able to create a shoe and that includes shoe type,
brand and a descritpion of the particular shoe that the user is creating. After, the user has 
created the shoe, the user now has the option to leave a review for the shoe. 
The user can then see what that shoe is currently rated at that time. This gives anyone that 
logs in access to any shoe that has been reviewed and rated by other users. 

I am open to anyone that is willing to help expand on my idea and improve the ability of the
application overall.
